Cajun Energy 4.0

Project Overview

Cajun Energy 4.0 is an advanced analytical tool developed as part of a senior design 
project at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. This project is designed to calculate the cost per 
kilogram of green hydrogen, incorporating a comprehensive model that includes not only the electrolyzer 
stack and system costs, as currently displayed on energy.gov, but also broader financial and logistical 
considerations.

Key Features

	•	Cost Calculation: Provides an accurate cost analysis for producing green hydrogen, considering various factors such as:
	•	Electrolyzer stack and system costs
	•	Land acquisition and property taxes
	•	Potential government incentives
	•	Installation specifics based on materials and spatial requirements for potential auxiliary uses like agriculture beneath solar installations.
	•	Renewable Energy Integration: Utilizes single-axis tracking solar panels and includes battery packs for backup energy storage.
	•	Flexible Parameters: Allows users to customize parameters to reflect the specific conditions of their intended installation location, anywhere in the world.
	•	Future Expansion: Plans to extend the model to include wind-to-hydrogen conversion and natural gas reformation via steam methane, 
     with a focus on market growth for products like ammonia and hydrogen.
